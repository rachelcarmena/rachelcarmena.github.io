## An idea

If you have a book library in your company, add a poster with some advice:

* No hurry.
* Rereading is allowed.
* Enjoy: if it's not the right moment for a particular book, take another one and try it again later.
* Take regular breaks for assimilation and reflection.
* Share what you read (conversations, posts, small talks, drawings, etc).
