## Errata

I've included an additional slide about "only one h1 per page". It's not a Success Criterion. It's a recommendation.

On the other hand, I've found several articles about this recommendation. It was said that it just made sense before HTML5. However, [HTML5 document outline is not implemented](http://html5doctor.com/computer-says-no-to-html5-document-outline) by assistive technology. You can read the advice and requirements about headings in [HTML5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-h1-h2-h3-h4-h5-and-h6-elements).

Thanks to Steve Faulkner, George Kerscher, Katie Haritos-Shea, Phill Jenkins, Michael Wayne Harris and Morten Tollefsen for their answers in [WAI Interest Group Discussion list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2018OctDec/0106.html).
