It was an intense and wonderful morning and I needed more than a few tweets ;)

First of all, I love this initiative, because it's related to all the underrepresented and marginalized people in tech, not only women. It was a diverse event and we had a diverse group of attendees.

## The event

It was divided into four main parts:

* Generating ideas.
* CFP: how to create a title, an abstract and a biography.
* Preparation of the talk: outline and slides.
* The day of the talk.

### Generating ideas

We organized a round table sharing reflections to make attendees find ideas and we got it!

They thought about themselves while we were talking and they found lots of ideas.

At that time, I realized about the great potential among our attendees with a diverse background and different interests. 

Besides that, I also realized that subjects like accessibility and security are still misunderstood. I think that all the professionals of software development should have a basic knowledge about them. Some people who work on such domains don't think that they have room in technical events. I would like to break those barriers, because they are subjects with a big interest for all of us, for our profession and our life!

One of the mentors, Patricia, has experience about technical research and she shared a reflection that impacted me: it's usual to listen to successful stories in technical research, not errors. Those errors exist and it would be very useful to know about them.

### How to create a title, an abstract and a biography

Besides talking about the characteristics of a title, I tried to create an inspiration moment reviewing some real titles. 

And I got it! Attendees created awesome titles for their talks during practice time.

Regarding the abstract, I talked about characteristics, questions that must answer and I gave advice as follows:

* Think about you are convincing a friend to attend your talk.
* Several opportunities or reviews. Make it 'work' and make it right later ;)
* Ask for feedback.

And attendees wrote an abstract for one of their previous titles. Great!

Emma talked about how to create a biography and I loved the activity she proposed to the attendees: every attendee wrote the biography of another one through an interview from a given list of questions. 

They read beautiful biographies at the end of the activity.

### Preparation of the talk: outline and slides

Patricia explained how to prepare the outline of the talk and gave a lot of ideas and advice.

César talked about the slides. I loved his idea of considering slides like **a visual support**, not **the presentation**. 

He made us reflect about alternatives of slides. Yes, they exist! Paper notes, text on other devices, whiteboards, having a paper board with partially prepared papers, ...

César is one of the organizers of TEDx in Valencia and he explained us how they're selecting the talks. They must follow the three I's:

* Interesting: it provides some value.
* Important: it's important to know about it.
* Individual: it provides a personal experience.

### The day of the talk

Finally, Mery gave a talk with _attrezzo_, showing everything she talked about: an USB, a connector, a bottle of water, even she showed a big cardboard with a checklist. 

It was a very good example for attendees and she gave a lot of interesting advice from her experiences.

## Got it!

After the activities during the morning and listening to attendees' feedback, I'm really happy with the result:

* They realized that they have a lot of things to share.
* They realized about the talks that they can prepare.
* Some fears were eliminated:
    * It's not necessary to be an expert to propose a talk: everybody has things to talk about when living an experience. A talk can provide not only knowledge but also reflection moments and an expert could find a lot of value when listening to anybody's experience.
    * The Q&A barrier: it doesn't matter if you don't know the answer to a question (asking audience for help, researching about it later, ...).

## Special kudos

A special kudos to people who encourage and join their friends to attend an event, because they think that it's interesting for them:

* One of the attendees wouldn't have come today by herself.
* Her friend knew that she had a great potential to share.
* At the end of the morning, her notebook was full of ideas: titles of talks that she could prepare, an abstract, a biography and lots of advice and other ideas.
