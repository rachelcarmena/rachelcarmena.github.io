This post has 2 different parts. Firstly, I talk about the power of the discussions. Secondly, I give an idea to have useful discussions.

However, maybe this post is talking about **estimates** and **documentation** ;)

## The power of discussions

I've participated in meetings to estimate tasks following Planning Poker. Sometimes, using the original cards. Other times, using other type of cards (for example, T-Shirt sizes).

I hardly saw an accurate estimate. 

However, I had very interesting discussions during those meetings:

* To understand the needs or the problem
* To divide, order or change the tasks

I remember this situation when I was 5-6 years old.

At night:

> **Me**: Mum, please, water!

> **My mother**: Here you are.

Another day:

> **Me**: Mum, please, water!

[a few minutes later]

> **My mother**: Here you are, my child, my child, your water.

> **Me**: Oh, mum, I fell asleep...

Another day:

> **Me**: Mum! Please, I cannot fall asleep. Can we play a game? I ask you for water, but you don't come. So, I will fall asleep as it happened the other day.

> **My mother**: What?

So, can we play a game? Can you ask us for an estimate? But you don't really want that estimate. You only want us to have a discussion to get valuable information.

## An idea to have useful discussions

A discussion can be a mess when each person has a different thing in mind. We cannot read the mind, so it's very useful to draw the ideas on a paper or a board.

> I don't know how to draw my idea

In order to face that situation, I find it very useful to know some notation or language to get graphical representations. I like to use BPMN or UML depending on the goal. 

A few days ago, [Ivar Jacobson](https://twitter.com/ivarjacobson), one of the creators of UML, wrote an article about it: [Rumors of the death of UML are all false](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rumors-death-uml-all-false-ivar-jacobson/). I love these sentences:

> No doubt that UML contains many very useful diagrams when discussing software architecture.

Sequence Diagrams are one of my favourites.

> (...) if UML is used in a smart way it really helps the teams to understand where they are heading.

On the other hand, [Simon Brown](https://twitter.com/simonbrown) thought about having different zoom levels to explain software architecture according to the target. 

He created the **C4 model** based on 4 zoom levels (or levels of abstraction):

1. **Context** in terms of the people who use it and the other software systems it interacts with.
2. **Containers**: applications, data stores, microservices, etc.
3. **Components** for each container.
4. **Code** for each component.

This model doesn't prescribe any particular notation for representing each zoom level.

I like this reflection by Simon Brown when talking about documentation:

> An **unfortunate** and **unintended side effect** of the **Manifesto for Agile Software Development** is that many teams have stopped or scaled back their diagramming and documentation efforts, including the use of UML.
