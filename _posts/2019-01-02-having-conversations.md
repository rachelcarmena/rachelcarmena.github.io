This post has 2 different parts. Firstly, I talk about the power of the conversations. Secondly, I give an idea to have useful conversations.

## The power of the conversations

I've participated in meetings to estimate tasks following Planning Poker. Sometimes, using the original cards. Other times, using other type of cards (for example, T-Shirt sizes).

I hardly saw an accurate estimation. However, I had very interesting conversations during those meetings:

* To understand the needs or the problem
* To divide, order or change the tasks

I remember this situation when I was 5-6 years old.

At night:

> **Me**: Mum, please, water!

> **My mother**: Here you are.

Another day:

> **Me**: Mum, please, water!

[a few minutes later]

> **My mother**: Here you are, my child, my child, your water.

> **Me**: Oh, mum, I fell asleep...

Another day:

> **Me**: Mum! Please, I cannot fall asleep. Can we play a game? I ask you for water, but you don't come. So, I will fall asleep as it happened the other day.

> **My mother**: What?

So, can we play a game? Can you ask us for an estimation? But you don't really want that estimation. You only want us to have a conversation to get valuable information.

## An idea to have useful conversations

A conversation can be a mess when each person has a different thing in mind. We cannot read the mind, so it's very useful to draw the ideas on a paper or a board.

> I don't know how to draw my idea

In order to face that situation, I find it very useful to know some notation or language to get graphical representations. I like to use BPMN or UML depending on the goal. 

A few days ago, [Ivar Jacobson](https://twitter.com/ivarjacobson), one of the creators of UML, wrote an article about it: [Rumors of the death of UML are all false](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rumors-death-uml-all-false-ivar-jacobson/). I love these sentences:

> No doubt that UML contains many very useful diagrams when discussing software architecture.

Sequence Diagrams are one of my favourites.

> (...) if UML is used in a smart way it really helps the teams to understand where they are heading.
