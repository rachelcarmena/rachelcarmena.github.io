> Rachel, I'm lost with so many names: Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, Extreme Programming, Agile methodologies and DevOps. And now you are talking about Software Craftsmanship. Absolutely lost. Where do we go? What methodology should I choose?

It was a difficult question and I needed to organize the mentioned methodologies and cultures.

In that moment, I remembered one of the reflection moments that came up when preparing a talk. 

I talked about [Software as a Craft](/2018/02/23/software-as-a-craft.html) at the University of Tarragona with a lot of students as attendees. However, I forgot to ask them if the **Waterfall model** was still taught there and how.

Taking the definition of [Extreme Humility](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeHumility) as a reference, I came up with these reflections.

![Waterfall](/img/cards/posts/coding-centered-methodology/waterfall.jpg)

There was a lack of humility, because it was thought that we could make each phase correctly one after another.

Developers were not expected to think, because they only had to program what another people thought. And experienced developers were promoted to think and they lose their expertise in programming.

There were also a separation between master (first phases) and apprentice (coding phase), the difficulty in giving feedback and a clear separation with Testing and Deployment phases at the end (_quick, quick, we're late_).

Alternatives to the Waterfall model were both the **iterative development** and the **incremental development**. Its combination led to new development methodologies.

The idea of Scrum for software development was presented by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber at [OOPSLA conference](http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla-history/) in 1995. All activity in the **Scrum Development Process** takes place within two inspect-and-adapt cycles: sprint and daily meeting.

**Kanban System** was developed by Taiichi Ohno, a vice president of Toyota, and Shigeo Shingo and it consists of a set of cards containing all the information required to be done on a product. They are used to control the work-in-progress (WIP), production and inventory flow.

**Scrumban** born as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban, when introducing Kanban to visualize, understand and continuously improve the way of working.

Kent Beck created **Extreme Programming** in 1996 and it takes values, principles and practices to extreme levels. As Kent Beck wrote:

> (...) there are certain things that you have to do to be doing XP. You don't get to choose whether or not you will write tests - if you don't, you aren't extreme (...)

In 2001, there was a discussion about all the new methodologies and the result was the [**Manifesto for Agile Software Development**](https://agilemanifesto.org). The [list of 12 principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) include:

* Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and **good design** enhances agility.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on **how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

These 3 principles are focused on professionalism and a well-craft software. However, in 2008, Robert C. Martin proposed a fifth value for the Agile Manifesto: _Craftsmanship over Crap_. 

More discussions came up with an extension of the Agile Manifesto in 2009: [**Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship**](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/). 

Software Craftsmanship is an approach to software development that inspires me the apprentice/master relationship, professionalism, practice to improve coding skills and the existence of communities.

DevOps term comes from [DevOpsDays](https://legacy.devopsdays.org/events/2009-ghent/), the conference that brings development and operations together since 2009. I understand DevOps as a culture of collaboration and cooperation between development and IT operations, working together towards a common objective.

So I think that we are travelling to a **coding-centered methodology** as follows:

* More humility when postponing decisions
* More humility when trying concrete experiments
* More humility when doing small and simple steps
* Getting fast feedback and embracing change
* Working together with a better communication
* Having common objectives as a team (business people and customer included)
* Having a common responsibility
* Having a better knowledge transmission
* Having a set of agile technical practices

And following a learning culture in order to share and improve our skills.

## Disclaimer

I usually simplify the terms with methodologies or cultures. However, there are more terms as methods, models, frameworks, processes or approaches, among others.

For example, the authors of Scrum called it "Scrum development process" to avoid [the method or methodology debate](http://wiki.c2.com/?MethodOrMethodology). However, it's also referred as an agile framework.

In this post, I usually used the terms that appear at the [Wiki](http://wiki.c2.com) by Ward Cunningham.
