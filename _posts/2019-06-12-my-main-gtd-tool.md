## Motivation

> Rachel, how do you organize yourself? With a Trello board?

> Hi! With a notebook and a pen.

## Introduction

After 2 internships and 2 fellowships, I got my first real job.

I received a branded notebook and a pen. No laptop, those were other times.

However, that notebook marked my time management from the beginning.

I started writing all the things I had to do. The list was growing.

> Ok, this is done. A strikethrough line? Oh, no, that's messy. What about a symbol?

## My notebook

I usually choose DinA4 size, because I'll also use the notebook to think and to draw diagrams, mind maps or schemes.

And I prefer not to mix colors on a single page of the notebook, so I only use a black or blue pen.

### List of tasks

I write down every pending task with an initial dash:

![Example of list on the notebook](/img/cards/posts/my-main-gtd-tool/list.jpg)

Anything that I must do is an item on the list.

I collect **everything**. 

This is one of the fundamental ideas about Getting Things Done (GTD).

It's necessary to get all the tasks out of your head: not to overload your mind with things to do, to prevent the stress feeling because of having a lot of things on your mind and to be able to focus on one thing.

### Priority tasks

If there are priority tasks on the list, I surround them to see them quickly:

![Example of priority tasks](/img/cards/posts/my-main-gtd-tool/priority-tasks.jpg)

And if there is a relationship between some priority tasks, I draw a line connecting them:

![Example of related priority tasks](/img/cards/posts/my-main-gtd-tool/connection.jpg)

### Marking as done

When I finish a task, I draw a check on the corresponding dash:

![Example of checked items](/img/cards/posts/my-main-gtd-tool/checked-items.jpg)

In this way, I can identify pending and finished tasks easily.

I prefer not to draw strikethrough lines in order to be able to read the finished tasks easily.

### Handling interruptions

It's easy to silence notifications on tools. However, what about personal interruptions?

I don't have a single way to handle those interruptions although I always need to write down something:

* When it's not an urgent need, I can inform them that I'm in the middle of a task and I'll contact them as soon as possible. It's important to write down that request not to forget it and to keep focused. 
* When it's an urgent request, I need to write down what I'm doing before the interruption. Just a few seconds will save me a lot of time afterwards.

### Reflecting

At the end of the day, I review the notebook to plan the next day:

* _This one is too big for a day. I'm going to split it. Tomorrow ..._ Otherwise, it will be a task ripe for procrastination.
* _I didn't do this one and it's important. I'll start with it tomorrow morning._ And that's translated into a surrounding area with a "1st" on it.
* _Pending tasks in several pages. I'm going to write them down again so as not to have to review so many pages_. When rewriting them, I reflect about them and they can be transformed into new tasks.
* _There were a lot of interruptions about ... I'm going to plan a task to review ..._
* etc.

## Other tools

In addition to the notebook, I need two calendars to organize myself:

* A **digital calendar** for working hours. I use different colors according to the type of event to get a quick planning overview.
* A **wall calendar** at home to organize my leisure time and to mark important events. The cheaper and best option is a simple calendar with enough room to write down things on each day.

When I need timeboxing or regular breaks, I use a **Pomodoro timer** to follow the [Pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) and I adapt the Pomodoro time according to the type of activities or my energy level in that moment (from 25 minutes to 40 minutes).

## Friendly reminder

Break down all the large tasks (not only development tasks).
